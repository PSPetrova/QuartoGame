Board game
Quarto is a board game for two players, it is played on a 4Ã—4 board. 
There are 16 unique pieces:
 <br />-tall or short;
 <br />-red or blue (or a different pair of colors, e.g. light- or dark-stained wood);
 <br />-square or circular; and
 <br />-hollow-top or solid-top.
Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. 
A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
