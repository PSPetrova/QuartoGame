# QuartoGame
Board game
Quarto is a board game for two players, it is played on a 4Ã—4 board. 
There are 16 unique pieces:
  * tall or short;
  * red or blue (or a different pair of colors, e.g. light- or dark-stained wood);
  * square or circular; and
  * hollow-top or solid-top.
Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. 
A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.).
